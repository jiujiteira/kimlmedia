        <p class="lead">Lead generation or conversions, which is the better objective for you?</p>

        <p>Both of them are really good depending on which stage you’re at in your Facebook ads journey, I’m going to tell you the pros and cons and at what point I think that you should be using each of them.  </p>

        <h5>Lead Generation</h5>        
        
        <p>This objective is really good if you’re just starting with Facebook ads and you haven’t really done much, you don’t really know how to mess with the pixel Lead gen is pretty simple to set up, the native lead form in Facebook makes it really easy for people to leave their information automatically, puts in all of their information (name, number and email).  </p>
       
        <p>The things with lead generation is that you’re going to have to sift through a lot of the leads that are coming because sometimes you get some tire kickers. People that weren’t really serious when they put in their information, you might even get people that didn’t even remember that they gave your information. The learning curve is much quicker but you’re going to have to sit through them and the sales process is going to be a little bit longer, you have to call more people. Although the cost per lead really cheap, just be aware of that.  </p>
        
        <p>When I do lead generation I always do this:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>On the first page I put “Step 1” and then I ask them to input their information but I don’t include the automatic name, number and email fields. I make them fill it out themselves. </li>
            <li>On the second page I put “Step 2” and redirect them either to book an appointment on an Acuity page or call the business or visit a webpage. </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Conversions</h5>

        <p>The conversions objective is better for someone who is a bit more seasoned with Facebook, you’ve got some experience you’ve run a few different campaigns in the past and you have money to spend on a good landing page or you know how to build a landing page.  </p>

        <p>Make sure it’s not just an average landing page because that could really hurt your results. If your landing page was put up quickly and it’s not mobile and iPad optimized, it doesn’t really look good and it’s slow to load, that will drastically hurt your lead conversions. You going to have really high cost for lead and that can get scary and expensive. So just be sure that you if you’re going to be going for conversions spend some money on getting a good landing page done</p> 

        <p>The cost per lead with conversions is higher, but the return on the investment is much better. People who took the time to go off the Facebook app, go through another website page and then put in their information and watch the explainer video, you will notice that these leads are more serious so you return on investment is generally going to be better. </p>
        
        <p>Also you need to make sure that your pixel is a correctly installed. You need to have a tracking code on your webpage and a conversions event code that fires at the click of a button or thank you page. It allows you keep track of everybody that’s coming through, which ads are performing better and so forth.  </p>
        
        <p>That’s my two cents with lead generation and conversions! </p>
