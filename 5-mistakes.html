        <p>This is something that I’ve noticed a lot, I use to make these mistakes myself. People who are trying to run Facebook ads to get leads to their own businesses tend to make these kinds of mistakes in the beginning.</p>
       
        <h5>You don’t let your ads do their thing</h5>     

        <p>You need a minimum of money and a minimum of time spent on your ads for it to actually give you accurate results in return. You can’t just put $5 or $10 on an ad and then wait 4 or 5 hours and think it’s a flop if you didn’t get a lead yet. </p>
        
        <p>You need to spend at least $100 on a campaign to see which ad sets actually worked for a minimum of 48 hours. Usually, when I start a campaign, I have three or four ad sets in there and then I’ll put a cap of $100 per ad set.</p>

        <h5>Using Stock Images</h5>

        <p>The creative that works the best is basically just putting your face in front of your audience.</p>

        <p>If you’re only using stock images your audience isn’t going to really respond well to that because they know right away that is a stock image, it just looks too professional, too polished and you don’t see the business owner. So avoid stock images!</p> 

        <p>Creative ideas are things like you speaking to the camera, or images of you practicing your craft. Say you’re a physical therapist, take images of you or a video of you actually doing physiotherapy. If you’re a car dealership, take images of your actual cars, of your car dealer or of your team.</p>

        <p>That’s what’s going to work really well.</p>

        <h5>Poor ad copy and no call to action</h5>

        <p>You need to have an ad copy formula to include the essentials in your ad copy for it to work. Again with the car dealer example, if you just put one headline and say “Come over to find the best car there is in town…” and don’t include a call to action and the benefits, the audience isn’t going to click on your ad (surprise). </p>
        <p>You need to start by calling out your audience, have an interesting offer, give them a solution to their problem and make them believe you understand them and can help.</p>
        <p>Finally, you need to include a call to action: “Click on this button to get your free pre-approval form!”</p>
        
        <h5>Not split-testing enough </h5>   

        <p>Split test your ads to find a winner. The last thing you want to do is just put one ad out, with one creative, one headline and one ad copy and just kind of see what happens.</p>
        <p>You always need to be split testing especially in the beginning. The first month will have the most amount of work, you need to split between winning headlines, creative, ad copy, objectives, placements, retargeting ads and more.</p>
        <p>Don’t just put one out of there and then watch it flop and say it doesn’t work for you. It works for every business, you just have to find what works for yours.</p>
        
        <h5>Getting Too Fancy</h5>

        <p>People like to see videos that that remind them of organic post. I touched on this with the stock images, but in my experience, making this crazy beautiful video (you know a long to 3-5 minute video explaining why you’re amazing with the highest quality camera and set that looks like a commercial) sometimes flops miserably.</p>
        <p>People want to see you doing your thing as if the content was taken with your phone and then posted up on your page. It speaks more to them, they feel like they’re actually beside you as you do your work.</p>
        <p>So yeah, sometimes getting too fancy can be a little overkill.</p>
        <p>That's it!</p>
