Should you do video or photos? What kind of video should you make if you’re going to use videos?  </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Both of them are really good depending on which stage you’re at in your Facebook ads journey, I’m going to tell you the pros and cons and at what point I think that you should be using each of them.  </p>

        <p>Let me start off by saying this: with local businesses, I’ve found that having video converts better. You could actually retarget people who watched your video but didn’t convert. People in your area want to know who they’re going to be dealing with and what the business is going to look like. It’s not exactly the same as having an online store where you just really want to see the product what it looks (images work fine for that). ln our case, we’re going to be exchanging a service so the audience is going want to know that they like you and if they like your business before they come in. </p>
       
        <h5>Business Owner Speaking To The Camera </h5>     

        <p>In this first example, you just stand in front of your business or in your business and speak to the camera as If you were speaking to your audience. You tell them about the offer, about yourself and the team and what problem you could help them with.  </p>

        <p>These videos are good because people can see you and they can get a vibe from you, they can see what your facility looks like and it’s a good idea for people to get to know you before visiting</p>

        <h5> MTV Cribs Style</h5>

        <p>You will basically have someone following you with a camera and you will be showing them around your business. For example, for a boxing gym, you show them “Okay this is the boxing gym, this is where we trying to hit the pad, this is the stretching area, this is the brand new facility we have, we have plenty of parking space over here.” </p>

        <p>Anytime you have a business has that kind of appeal, do it. This won’t be the best idea for something like an accounting firm, because it doesn’t necessarily matter that you’ve got a nice accounting firm or not, people aren’t really going to be spending a lot of time there. </p> 

        <h5>Action Video</h5>

        <p>Once again if you got a business like a gym or health care clinic, an action video of people actually taking their gym class or doing yoga, or you actually working on a patient, taping their knee, doing some rehabilitation exercises, these are good for business where there’s going to be some sort of action visual action that’s going to be happening.  </p>
        
        <h5>Finished Product</h5>   

        <p>This will work well if you have something like a construction company, or a business where you can visually show the finished product. Let’s use an epoxy flooring company. You can do a slideshow of a bunch of finished floors, garage floors and basements, some of the restaurant that you’ve done, office spaces, buildings, anything! This is where you really show off your work and shine.   </p>
        
        <p>One of these is bound to work for your business, you just need to figure out which one is relevant to yours!</p>
