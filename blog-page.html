        <p class="lead">Now, let’s dive into the math. It’s important to understand a few key concepts before deciding on your ad budget.</p>

        <p>As a point of reference, spending under $600-$700 a month on Facebook ads won’t give you enough wiggle room to get some true data. So spend at least this minimum when starting. Once you figure out what offer, ads and funnel works best for you, you can ramp up advertising cost. </p>

        <h5>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) </h5>
        <p>Before we begin, let’s figure out what your customer LTV is. Say you’re a boxing gym with a monthly membership cost of $70. The average member stays for about 12 months. </p>
        <p>$70 X 12 months = $840</p> 
        <p>Now, what are your profit margins for each member? We want to figure out what it costs each time a new member joins the gym. Say you give them a pair of boxing gloves and tape when they sign up on their first month. We do not include fixed costs (i.e. rent, hydro, trainers, etc.), we just want to know if there is a direct material cost for a new member. Over 12 months of membership costs, the gloves and tape equal to around 10% cost. </p>
        <p>$840 – 10% = <strong>$756</strong> </p>
        <p>Now, how many referrals do you typically get from a member? Let’s say for every person who joins the gym, they bring along at least one friend or family member on average: </p>
        <p>$756 X 2 people = <strong>$1,512</strong></p>
        <p>So, we know now that the average lifetime value of a member at your boxing gym is $1,512.</p>
        <h5>Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) </h5>
        <p>We want to know how much it will cost us to acquire a new customer through Facebook ads. First off, we need to know what your average cost per lead is. Go through your data of the past 12 months and calculate the number of leads you’ve gotten and the number of leads who became customers. For simplicity’s sake, we’re going to use rounded numbers. </p>
        <p>Say that your gym had 1000 inquiries through Facebook messenger, Instagram Direct, Facebook Ads, Google ads, phone calls, walk-ins and a fitness discount app last year. 400 people came to the gym to try out a class, but only 120 of them became new members. </p>
        <p>Show up rate: 400 / 1000 = 0.4 = <strong>40% </strong></p>
        <p>Closing rate: 120 / 400 = 0.3 = <strong>30% </strong></p>
        <p>On average, a gym membership lead on Facebook can cost anywhere between $7 to $15 depending on the quality. Say that your cost per lead is around $11. To figure out your CPA, follow this formula: </p>
        <p>Lead Cost/Show Up Rate/Closing Rate —-> $11/0.4/0.3 = <strong>$91</strong></p>
        <p>So, now you know how much money it costs to acquire a customer. Every time you spend $91 on Facebook ads, you will make $1,512 in customer LTV. Not bad eh? </p>
        <p>Say you spend our recommended $700 ads budget to begin with, you would: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate 63 leads </li>
          <li>Get 7 new members </li>
          <li>Make $441 in front end value </li>
          <li>Make <strong>$10,584</strong> in lifetime value </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you knew you could invest $700 in the stock market today and make $10,584 within 12 months, would you do it? <br>
          If you knew you could invest $700 in the stock market today and make $10,584 within 12 months, would you do it? </p>
        <p>Of course, you would. </p>  
        <p>That’s why this is so powerful. </p>
